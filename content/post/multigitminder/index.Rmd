Setting new goals is easy, achieving them is hard.  

I have used a variety of tools over the years to help me achieve my goals. For the last couple of years, I've used a combination of Google Docs, Google Calendar, Google Keep, Loop Habit Tracker, Trello, and good ol' alarm clocks to schedule tasks and remind myself to get things done. Whether these goals were personal or professional, small or big, they would usually find their way into one of these tools with the hope that it would hold me accountable. 

When it came to my major goals (e.g. "do real good in school", "get a job"), these tools were more organizational than motivational. If a goal is truly important to me, I don't struggle to find internal motivation. Conversely, I have set many goals that sit in a grey area of internal motivation. These goals are much more difficult for me to achieve because they are deemed not-so-important or completely necessary, even though they are enjoyable and fulfilling activities. Unfortunately, their lack of priority means that they are often side-lined by major goals or leisurely activities.

Examples of these "not-so-important" goals include:

- Read 12 books this year
- Go for a run 3 times per week
- Meditate for 10 minutes every day

If you have set goals like these in the past, you will know how easy it is to say "Meh... I'll do it tomorrow", as you shovel potato chips into your mouth while wearing pajamas at noon because a pandemic is ravaging the outside world. Ok, maybe that imagery is a little too specific. The point is that the tools I was using to organize my goals were simple reminder engines. Reminders alone are useful if you are motivated and organized at the very moment they arrive. If you are not, they have no real power to hold you accountable. It is extremely easy to swipe away a push notification, especially when you are not in the mood for it.  

For the last 6 months, I have been using a tool that has radically changed my mindset regarding these types of goals. That tool is Beeminder. 

>"It's reminders with a sting! Or, goal-tracking with teeth."

The simplified premise of Beeminder is as follows:

- Set a goal
- Create a commitment contract (e.g. "I will run 3 times per week")
- Input your data (manually or via app integrations)
- Stay on track or Beeminder charges your credit card

In my experience, when I introduce Beeminder to people for the first time they usually think one of two things:

1. "Wow, that sounds great!"
2. "Wow, that app would take all my money."

Fair enough, Beeminder is not for everyone because everyone is motivated differently. For me, Beeminder provided the missing piece of the puzzle for my lower priority goals. 

TALK ABOUT DELAYED GRATIFICATION AND BRINGING FUTURE CONSEQUENCES TO THE PRESENT

Previous tools only provided a single type of motivation: a positive mental or physical reward in the future. Whereas with Beeminder, I still have the internal motivation to achieve these goals for my own fulfillment, but also I

I made a GitHub Action that helps Beeminder users capture their programming activity as data for their goals.
